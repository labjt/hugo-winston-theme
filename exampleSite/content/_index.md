Who Do I Work With?

##1. You're counting down:##
Most of my clients are either kicking up their feet already or staring hard at that retirement finish line (typically at least a mere 10 years out). Hospital executives seem to like me, but hey, if you're getting closer to those golden years in any profession, I'm your person.

2. You're a Saver
My clients may not see themselves as rich but thanks to years of dillligence, they've stashed away at least $750,000. They may not think they're “rich,” but they're richer than they were in their twenties, that’s for sure.

3. You're nice:
I've got a strict "no jerks" policy. If you're genuinely kind-hearted and respectful, we'll get along like swimmingly. And yes, this one's so important it probably should've been at the top.

4. You want help
A lot of financial planning is common sense, see no. 2. But planning for a comfortable retirement with you're specific cirumstances get's complicated, especially when your behavior get's in the way. You appreciate the value of leaving the retirement jigsaw puzzle to a pro.

By the way...

I hang my hat in Shreveport, Louisiana. But thanks to the magic of the internet (and good old-fashioned phones), you can be anywhere, and we'll make it work.

You fan follow me on linkedin below, sign up for my newsletter, send me an email, or schedule a intro call below. Otherwise, I think you have just about everything you need to make a decision on whether to take that first step.
